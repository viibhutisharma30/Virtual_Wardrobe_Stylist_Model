Virtual Wardrobe Stylist is an AI-powered fashion recommendation system that helps users choose the best outfit combinations based on their body type and wardrobe preferences.<br> The system uses real-time body type detection through Mediapipe pose tracking, analyzing shoulder and hip landmarks to determine the best outfit fit.<br>

The recommendation engine is powered by the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm, trained on wardrobe data that includes item type, color, occasion, and season.<br> Users can upload images of their wardrobe items, and the system provides outfit suggestions based on compatibility and fashion trends.<br>

The project is implemented using Python and integrates key technologies such as Mediapipe for pose detection, OpenCV for image processing, and Flask for building a user-friendly web interface.<br> 

To use the Virtual Wardrobe Stylist, users need to upload images of their clothing items, allow the webcam to detect body landmarks, and receive AI-powered outfit recommendations.<br> This system enhances the fashion selection process, ensuring users always have the best outfit options available for any occasion.<br>
